## Mission (1 paragraph)

Fully procedural 4×4 km open world in the browser. WebGPU only (three.js WebGPURenderer + TSL +
raw WGSL compute), TypeScript strict, zero `any`, zero external assets, deterministic by
`?seed=N`. Visual bar: the four UE5-class reference images in `reference/` (noon forest ravine
w/ cobbled streambed; gully close-up; karst tower forest in haze; golden-hour serrated alpine
vista w/ snow + cloud sea below summits — "Witcher" frame). 8 gated phases; verification by
Playwright screenshots compared against references; `DELTA.md` loop each phase. Must ALSO be
smooth + explorable interactively by the user (fly camera, ToD control, bookmarks) — user
feedback comes in chat; the two-frame test is the agent-side acceptance only.

## Hard rules digest (full text = spec §)

- No black/gray shadows (Pillar B); no bare terrain within 10 m (Pillar A/§9); no cloned trees;
  no smooth silhouettes on hero rock/tree; no fog-as-cover; no `MeshBasicMaterial`; no CPU
  per-instance updates; no one-file architecture; never ask user to lower the bar.
- Floors (§2): ≥5M tris forest hero / ≥3M vista post-culling; 4096² heightfield sim; erosion
  ≥500 iters @ ≥2048²; ≥6 tree species w/ per-instance uniqueness; hero tree ≥100k tris; hero
  rock ≥200k tris; grass ≥800k blades; debris ≥80k; particles ≥100k; visible range ≥4 km;
  ≥5 biomes incl. alpine snow; probes ≥24×24×6 per chunk; CSM 4×≥2048² + PCSS + contact
  shadows; raymarched 2-layer clouds + cloud shadows; Hillaire atmosphere; 60 fps @ 1440p
  target hardware class.
- Infeasible item → nearest feasible alternative + entry in `DEVIATIONS.md`. A closed phase has
  zero TODOs in its code.

## Verified environment facts

- macOS 26.4 (Darwin 25.4.0), Apple **M1 Max 32-core GPU**, Metal 4, 3456×2234 display.
- Node v22.12.0, npm 10.9.0. Git repo initialized on `main` (no remote).
- three.js pinned: **0.184.0** (latest on npm as of 2026-06-10). VERIFY APIs against
  `node_modules/three/` source before use — do not trust memory for TSL surface.
- **Playwright WebGPU recipe (SOLVED)**: `chromium.launch({ headless: true, channel: 'chromium' })`
  → apple/metal-3 adapter. Two traps: (1) WebGPU only exists on secure contexts — probe on
  http://localhost:5173, never about:blank; (2) default Playwright headless = GPU-less
  "headless shell"; `channel:'chromium'` selects full Chromium new-headless. Cached in
  `.cache/webgpu-flags.json` by tools/launch.ts.
- Dev server: `npm run dev` (background, port 5173 strict). Shots:
  `npx tsx tools/shoot.ts --scene X --cam "..." --out shots/x.png [--hud 1] [--stats f.json]`.
  Compare: `npx tsx tools/compare.ts --a ours.png --b reference/sceneN.png --out cmp.png`.
  Pixel sampling (shadow-color test): `--sample img.png --px "x,y;x,y"`.
- Sanity scene measured (1080p, M1 Max): 3.1M tris @ 117 fps, render 7.2 ms — lots of headroom.

## Phase checklist

- [x] **Phase 0** — DONE 2026-06-10. Scaffold, WebGPU init + fail-loud diagnostics, HUD, fly
      camera, params, Playwright shot harness (headless WebGPU working), compare tool. Gate
      passed: `shots/phase-0/cmp_sanity_vs_scene1.png`. Proven: compute→storage→instanced draw,
      compute→StorageTexture→sampling, TSL vertex displacement, CPU procedural geometry,
      GPU timestamps, deterministic seeding.
- [x] **Phase 1** — DONE 2026-06-11. 4096² synth (macro layout: NE massif/valley/karst/lake w/
      outlet), pipe erosion 640 it @2048 (hardness-aware thermal), multigrid lake fill, particle
      flow accumulation → carved rivers, moisture, biome+snow classify (coarse-slope hold +
      couloirs + ledges + dither), CDLOD instanced tiles + far shell w/ analytic normals +
      far-detail normal synthesis, PBR splat material (strata/iron bands/lichen/macro variation/
      wet darkening/snow), erosion split view, ground-clamped camera (`x/z/alt/yaw`), CPU height
      readback. Gates passed; see docs/DELTA.md Phase 1. Artifacts: shots/phase-1/.
- [x] **Phase 2** — DONE 2026-06-11. Hillaire LUT atmosphere + aerial perspective (post-pass
      camera-uniform bug fixed — explicit uCamPos/uProjInv/uCamWorld); GPU auto-exposure
      (key 0.125); hemisphere ambient (IBL env path dead → Phase 3 probes); CSM×4 + PCSS +
      screen-space contact shadows (12-step depth march, near-field, floored); volumetric
      clouds (half-res RTT march, baked weather, cloud sea below summits + cloud shadow map);
      TRAA, GTAO (depth-derived normals, distance-faded), bloom, per-ToD grade (strong
      teal-orange golden split). Gates PASSED: golden vista vs Witcher (DELTA.md Phase 2,
      ~70% of ref without vegetation), shadow-color test (chroma 18.3/255, no gray).
      Artifacts: shots/phase-2/. Known debts → DELTA items 1,4,7–10.
- [x] **Phase 3** — DONE 2026-06-11 (vegetation-dependent parts deferred w/ DEVIATIONS).
      Irradiance probe field: 256×256×6 TERRAIN-RELATIVE layers (1.5–105 m above ground),
      heightfield ray-march gather (16 dirs × 16 steps, sun horizon test + albedo proxy +
      sky LUT misses), SH-L1 → 3×rgba16f 3D textures, time-sliced 3072/frame (~2 s refresh,
      invalidate() fast-converge on ToD jumps), injected via IrradianceNode (setupLightMap
      patch); hemisphere dimmed to 0.15× floor. GTAO: depth-derived normals + distance fade
      + luminance-masked 'indirect-only' approx (DEVIATIONS D-1). Screen-space bounce +
      foliage translucency → Phase 4 (D-2). Probe density vs spec floor → D-3.
      VERIFIED: no-black-shadows at golden hour (darkest-20 lum 61.8, chroma 20.1 — AgX-toe
      desat fixed); ?view=probes ambient-only debug view; +3 ms GPU. Forest-interior gate
      re-judged after Phase 4 (no forest exists). Artifacts: shots/phase-3/.
- [ ] **Phase 4** — generators: 6+ tree species (per-instance growth), rocks/cliffs, grass, ferns,
      shrubs×3, flowers×4 (incl. pink shrub), deadfall, debris classes, procedural texture arrays,
      dressing systems (moss/vines/ledge ferns/root flare/fungi/staining), octahedral impostors,
      `?scene=gallery`. Gate: gallery sheet + macro-meso-micro audit.
- [ ] **Phase 5** — GPU scatter (clustered Poisson, density fns), chunk streaming, meshlet/cluster
      culling + Hi-Z + indirect, LOD/impostor transitions (dithered), far forests as canopy
      shells. Gate: repetition flight; throughput floors (HUD-verified).
- [ ] **Phase 6** — stream water (refraction/caustics/foam/wet margins), lakes (planar refl),
      hierarchical wind, froxel volumetrics (canopy shafts, valley fog), GPU particles
      (snow/pollen/leaves). Gate: streambed close-up vs scene1/2.
- [ ] **Phase 7** — perf pass (60fps@1440p / reduced preset), HUD full (per-pass GPU timings),
      9 bookmarks, 90s flythrough, full battery, final two-frame test, self-score rubric.
- [ ] **Tier 3** — only after battery passes (see spec §11).

## Current focus

**Phase 2 — atmosphere, shadows, clouds, post** + USER FEEDBACK BATCH 1 (2026-06-11).

User feedback (all four addressed, commits e939266/575b621/next):
1. PERF "~40fps before objects": root-caused via new `?ablate=` + `--gpusample` median
   harness → terrain splat material was ~52 ms of a 73.5 ms GPU frame (35 live noise
   evals/px). Fixed: `NoiseBake.ts` baked value/fbm/ridged + PRE-DERIVED GRADIENT
   textures; GTAO samples 16→8 (defaults cost ~50 ms on vistas); clouds half-res RTT +
   baked weather; 3D-distance quadtree split; castShadowPositionNode (nearest, no morph);
   CSM maxFar 3200. NOW: 19–23 ms GPU @1080p all views (was 73–134). Phase 7 finishes
   (vsync-real fps; spikes re-check on live flythrough).
2. EROSION "sharp diagonal/straight 1-cell trenches, predictable lake patterns": particle
   trace was D8 (8-direction snap) → continuous bilinear-gradient descent w/ inertia;
   strength field blurred before carve (channels have width); carve faded inside lakes;
   particles STOP on filled flats (ε-tilt alignment printed parallel lines) and in lakes;
   hardness-aware talus relax (26 it) post-carve rounds trench walls, towers protected;
   trench enforcement got V-profile (was rectangular select) + fine meander warp octave
   (61 m / ±16 m) so spline trenches aren't ruler-straight; kettle ponds render dark
   (were gravel-gray dots). VERIFIED shots/wip/fix-round2-*.png.
3. LOD "center always high detail": VERIFIED FALSE for the quadtree (live setPose test:
   rings follow camera; `?view=lod` debug added). Real causes user saw: far shell beyond
   world edge + coarse cliffs (see 4). 3D split distance stops altitude over-refine.
4. MESHING "stretched verts on slopes": skirted patches (PlaneGeometry +2 ring, clamp +
   drop in shader → crack-proof) + error-biased splits (height-range mip pyramid; rough
   tiles split earlier and down to 32 m → 0.5 m quads on cliff close-ups). Snow dither
   gated near boundary (white speckle on rock fixed).

Phase 2 items: 1–5 BUILT as before (atmosphere LUTs, SunSky, CSM+PCSS, clouds, post).
CLOUDS NOW VISIBLE AND CORRECT — root causes were (a) quad-pass camera uniforms
(cameraPosition/WorldMatrix/ProjectionMatrixInverse are the POST QUAD camera inside
RenderPipeline.outputNode → explicit uCamPos/uProjInv/uCamWorld uniforms now) and
(b) depth convention is CLASSIC here (sky d=1.0, not reversed) → isSky + maxD fixed.
Aerial perspective only became truly distance-correct with the same fix.
`?cloudview=1..9` probe ladder kept (tone mapping auto-off when probing).

PHASE 2 CLOSED 2026-06-11 (see checklist + DELTA.md). All listed items landed: cloud art
pass (contrast-stretched weather, isotropic phase floor, base-darkened ambient, default
cov 0.62), contact shadows (?ablate=contact to A/B), black facets root-caused to GTAO
(NOT PCSS — depth-derived normals fixed it), gate + shadow-color test PASSED.

**Phase 4 — generators: 6+ tree species, rocks/cliffs, grass, shrubs, flowers,
deadfall/debris, dressing, impostors, ?scene=gallery.** The single biggest visual gap
(DELTA Phase-2 #1). Strategy D5: K structural variants per species per LOD ring +
continuous per-instance GPU deformation + bespoke hero meshes near camera.

## Next actions (always keep current)

- Phase 4 design pass: procedural tree builder architecture (branching skeleton →
  mesh ribs → leaf cards w/ procedural texture ARRAYS), species params (conifer ×2,
  broadleaf ×2, karst-gnarled, snag), rock/boulder builder (cube-sphere + ridged
  displacement + hardness strata), grass blade geometry, gallery scene for the
  macro–meso–micro audit. Wire aoNode + translucency + SS-bounce during material
  build (DEVIATIONS D-1/D-2 close-out).
- KNOWN visual debts (carried): DELTA Ph-2 #4 (2nd cloud layer, Ph 6), #7 (gate
  framing anchor), #10 (god rays, Ph 6); kettle-pond density (Ph 6 water); terrain
  20 M tris at massif views (shadow culling, Ph 5).

## Key decisions log

- **D1** Pin three@0.184.0; mitigation for API drift: read installed source, keep notes in
  docs/THREE-NOTES.md. Downgrade to 0.180.x only if 0.184 breaks something structural.
- **D2** Tracking: STATUS.md (this file) = source of truth; harness task list mirrors phases
  (tasks #1–#8 = phases 0–7); git commit per milestone. DELTA.md / DEVIATIONS.md per spec.
- **D3** World macro-layout is code-guided for art direction (composed, per Pillar E): main
  glacial U-valley NE→SW with river → lake in SW low corner; serrated alpine massif N/NE
  (Witcher frame); tower-karst forest ravine biome center-S (scene1/3); meadows + rolling
  forest between; wetland margin at lake. Detail fully procedural + seed-driven.
- **D4** Verification screenshots: prefer headless Playwright Chromium with WebGPU/Metal flags;
  fall back to headed if headless adapter unavailable. (Resolved Phase 0 → record flags above.)
- **D5** Per-instance tree uniqueness strategy: K structural variants per species per LOD ring
  + continuous per-instance GPU deformation (lean/droop/crown asymmetry/age/hue) + bespoke
  unique meshes for nearest hero trees (background-generated, cached). Document in DEVIATIONS.
- **D6** Erosion default 2048² active grid (spec floor) on 4096² synth field; `?quality=ultra`
  runs 4096². Decide final default by measured load time (~budget ≤15 s gen).

## Reference image analysis (art targets)

- `scene1.png` 1920×1080-class, noon ravine: cobbled dry streambed w/ trickle, rounded mossy
  boulders, dark cliff overhangs framing top corners, lush karst towers midground, luminous
  white-blue haze bg. Shadows: blue-gray on rock, green-filled in foliage. Value structure:
  dark frame → lit mid → bright bg.
- `scene2.png` gully close-up: deadfall logs across cobbles, deep-green mossy overhang (shadowed
  but COLORFUL), sunlit tower behind.
- `scene3.png` karst forest vista: dozens of vegetated rock towers receding through 4+ haze
  layers; canopy sea between towers; soft broken-cloud toplight.
- `02_Silver_Demo_Wallpaper...png` (Witcher IV, 3840×2160): golden hour alpine; dark foreground
  outcrop + figure (silhouette framing); serrated rust-red peaks w/ slope-correct snow; conifer
  slopes down to huge hazy valley; cloud sea BELOW summits wrapping ridges; god rays from
  upper-left sun; teal-orange split (warm rock/lit conifers vs cool snow shadows/valley haze);
  scattered dead snags on right slope.
- Implied landforms: serrated ridged massif + vertical-walled tower karst + glacial valley.
  Terrain synthesis needs an explicit tower/mesa formation term, not just ridged fBm.

## Phase 1 progress snapshot (2026-06-10)

Done: synthesis (macro layout + karst towers + anisotropic ridges), pipe-model erosion
(hardness-aware thermal), multigrid lake fill, particle flow accumulation, river carve +
channel enforcement, lake w/ outlet, moisture; debug hillshade preview + `?view=hydro`.
Remaining for phase close: TerrainTiles (CDLOD quadtree + far shell), real PBR terrain
material (triplanar/splats/snow/macro variation), biome+snow classify pass, `?scene=terrain`
split view, ground-clamped camera helper, silhouette/tiling gate + DELTA.md.

## Gotchas / lessons learned (append-only)

- WebGPU secure-context + headless-shell traps → see "Verified environment facts".
- TSL `.assign()/.addAssign()/.toVar()` require an active stack (inside `Fn()`); material node
  graphs are NOT inside Fn → shared TSL helpers must be pure expression builders (NoiseTSL is).
- @types/three 0.184 types nodes generically: use `Node<'vec3'>` aliases from `src/gpu/TSLTypes.ts`
  (`NF/NV2/NV3/NV4…`); bare `Node` has no operators/swizzles.
- `three` and `three/webgpu` both re-export from `three.core.js` — safe to mix imports.
- `StorageTexture` defaults rgba8unorm + `mipmapsAutoUpdate=true` (auto mips after compute
  writes when generateMipmaps). For float data set `.type = FloatType` etc.
- Verify cast shadows w/ custom `positionNode` on instanced meshes when real shadows land
  (Phase 2) — sanity scene shadows looked absent; may need `material.shadowPositionNode`.
- Compute storage-buffer limit: default 8 per stage — request more via
  `requiredLimits` (done in Engine; adapter max here = 10) AND keep kernels lean.
- TSL atomics: `instancedArray(n,'uint').toAtomic()`; then ALL access via
  atomicStore/atomicAdd/atomicLoad; `float(atomicLoad(...) as unknown as NU)` for reads
  (AtomicFunctionNode lacks value-typed methods in @types).
- mx_noise/mx_fractal outputs are SIGNED — remap explicitly or lowlands sink below
  lake level ("puddle plague").
- Relaxation-style fills propagate ~1 cell/iter: ALWAYS multigrid them.
- A lake without an outlet river floods its valley to the spill saddle.
- Endless-loop debug rule: when iterating visual passes "with no effect", first verify the
  served code changed (curl the module), THEN check upstream state assumptions.
- Per-component Rng streams (seed.rng('x')): adding draws must never re-roll other systems.
- 1D dispatch >65535 workgroups: three auto-splits to 2D and instanceIndex stays linear —
  but pad-guard every kernel (`If(i >= N) Return()`).
- RenderPipeline.outputNode runs on a QUAD camera: `cameraPosition`/`cameraWorldMatrix`/
  `cameraProjectionMatrixInverse` resolve to THAT camera (silently wrong values, no error).
  Pass scene-camera uniforms explicitly (this is why three's GTAO/TRAA take `camera`).
- Depth here is CLASSIC convention (sky/clear = 1.0). Verify per pass — don't assume
  reversed-z. Probe in-shader (paint values) rather than reasoning from docs.
- Tooling traps: vite fsevents misses tool-driven writes → `server.watch.usePolling` in
  vite.config; esbuild strips comments from served TS → grep served code for IDENTIFIERS
  only; numeric literals get rewritten (1000 → 1e3).
- `fps` in headless ≠ GPU throughput (CPU submits ahead). Use gpuPasses timestamps,
  median over many samples (`tools/shoot.ts --gpusample N`), plus `?ablate=` attribution.
- GTAONode defaults (16 samples) cost ~50 ms on 1080p terrain vistas; resolutionScale 0.5
  produced row-streak artifacts — keep full res, 8 samples.
- Filled-DEM flats have a UNIFORM ε-tilt: particles crossing them all align to it and
  print parallel straight lines. Stop particles below ~2× the ε slope (and in lakes).
- device.onuncapturederror is wired in Engine — silent black frames usually mean a
  LOGIC bug (wrong uniforms), not a validation error.
